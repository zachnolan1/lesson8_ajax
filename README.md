### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The AJAX function is a behind the scenes kind of function, it allows our website to interact with servers to get the information we need onto our page.
2. software companies release their APIs to developers to allow them to power their own products.
3. JSON is an extention of the JavaScript scripting language. Web services and APIs use JSON format to provide public data because the data interchange is readable and user friendly.
